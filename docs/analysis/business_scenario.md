# Business Scenario

## Summary

**Math Mini** is an **interactive educational web application** for young adults that teaches mathematical concepts through visual, hands-on exercises.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

- **Students aged 8-10 years old** (3rd-4th grade)

### Secondary Users

- **Parents** monitoring their children's progress
- **Teachers** looking for supplementary educational tools

## Problem Statement

Traditional mathematics education often struggles with:
- Lack of immediate feedback
- Difficulty visualizing abstract concepts (graphs, fractals)
- Limited engagement through static textbook exercises

## Solution

A browser-based educational platform that engages young adults and teaches them mathematical concepts with interactive exercises and computed visualizations.

### Educational Topics

| Topic | Theory Focus | Practice/Visualization |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Arithmetic** | Basic operations, order of operations | Drag-and-drop expression building |
| **Fractions** | Parts of a whole, comparison | Drag-and-drop ordering fractions |
| **Graphs** | Function visualization, real-world relationships | Interactive 4-function graph plotter |
| **Fractals** | Self-similarity, natural patterns | Sierpinski triangle with depth control |

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: % of students who complete all 4 topics
- **User Retention**: Students returning to complete additional topics

## Technical Constraints

- Must work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Business Value

- **Zero Infrastructure Cost**: Pure client-side application
- **Easy Distribution**: Single folder of files, shareable via USB, email, school network
- **Accessibility**: Works on any device with a modern browser

## Competitive Advantages

1. Multi-user support in a single-file application
2. Advanced visualizations (Web Workers for computation)

## Future Expansion

- More topics (geometry, algebra, statistics)
- Multi-language support
